Exercise 6 of the "C# Class Development" course of the "C# Programming for Unity Game Development" Specialization by the University of Colorado via Coursera

## Description

Implement the TakeBite for the Apple class from the previous exercises. Here’s the class diagram as a reminder:
* [Apple class diagram](./apple_class_diagram.png)

Add code to your Main method to declare a constant bite size, then use a while loop to take bites out of the apple until it’s gone. Print out the amount of the apple that’s left in the body of the while loop. Make sure you never bite more of the apple than is left to eat when you bite the apple in the body of the while loop.
